# London-Dwelling-Fires-Analysis

This is a quantitative data analysis project investigating London Dwelling Fire Incidences.

The main method used is an OLS Multiple Linear Regression in Python.

You can directly look at `3-OLS_Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb` to look at the results of our analysis.

If you are interested in the data preparation that was undertaken, check out `1-Data_Cleaning.ipynb` and `2-Variable_Preparation.ipynb`.

All the census datasets used as independent variables have been provided in the `London Dwelling Fires Analysis` folder; the original datasets were downloaded from the Nomis Webpage Census Topic Summaries.
Links have been provided in the python notebooks to download the LFB Incidents Records Dataset and the London Wards shapefiles.
